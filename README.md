# Java Security API Checklist

This README serves as a checklist to explore and implement the diverse features offered by the Java Security API. These features extend beyond basic cryptography and include authentication, secure communication, and more.

## Cryptography
- [ ] Implement symmetric encryption (e.g., AES)
- [ ] Implement asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA)
- [âœ…] Use message digest algorithms (e.g., SHA-256)
- [ ] Generate and verify digital signatures
- [ ] Perform password-based encryption (PBE)
- [ ] Explore Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
- [ ] Generate cryptographic keys and manage key agreements
- [ ] Implement message authentication codes (MACs)
- [ ] Utilize secure random number generators

## Secure Communication
- [ ] Establish SSL/TLS connections
- [ ] Manage and validate certificates using Certificate Facto
- [ ] Handle different types of SSLContexts for various security protocols
- [ ] Implement secure sockets using SSLSocket and SSLServerSocket

## Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] Set up and use the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS)
- [ ] Create custom login modules
- [ ] Manage subjects, principals, and credentials

## Key Management
- [ ] Utilize Java KeyStore to store and manage cryptographic keys securely
- [ ] Load, retrieve, and store keys/certificates in a KeyStore
- [ ] Integrate with hardware security modules (HSM) if applicable

## Java Security Manager
- [ ] Implement custom security policies
- [ ] Control resource access (files, sockets, etc.) using AccessController
- [ ] Use Permission objects to secure application components

## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- [ ] Use Java APIs for certificates and certificate validation
- [ ] Implement Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)
- [ ] Utilize Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) for certificate status checking

## Advanced Topics
- [ ] Explore XML Digital Signatures for securing XML documents
- [ ] Implement token-based authentication mechanisms like JWT
- [ ] Use Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) for secure communication

## Utilities and Tools
- [ ] Use security utilities like keytool for managing keystores
- [data] Integrate with logging frameworks to audit security-related events
- [ ] Leverage the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) for
